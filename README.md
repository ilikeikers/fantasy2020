web scraper to build fantasy player list

This was a project started when I was first getting back into programming. It uses Pandas and BeautifulSoup to scrape NFL Player Data and then sort them in a list. 
This was used to make my draft list in a new startup Dynasty Fantasy League.
This was a really bad way to do it. My new (slightly better) attempt at a similar project can be found in the SleeperSpider repo. 

I still haven't won a chamionship.
